# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the provided code attempts to parse a user ID from the request parameters as an integer without checking for potential errors (e.g., if the ID is not a number or is otherwise malformed).

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with appropriate error handling.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file shows the vulnerable code, where a missing check results in potential errors if the `userId` is not a valid integer.  This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected code.  The solution includes a check to ensure the `userId` is a number and handles the case where the user is not found.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in Express.js applications to prevent unexpected issues and enhance the overall stability of your application.
